The Policy Lab: Data Science Intern Performance Task

Scenario: As part of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rhode Island is considering setting up vaccination sites at several schools in Providence. They have asked The Policy Lab to determine which schools they should choose that would maximize access and equity.

Your task: As a first pass at this question, the Head of Data Science has asked you to answer some initial questions about the feasibility of this plan. In particular, they have asked:

1. How many people live in Providence?
2. How many people who are at least 65 years old live in Providence?
3. How many people who are at least 65 years old live within one mile of Classical High School in Providence (called CLASSICAL in the data set)?
4. What is the mean distance a resident of Providence who is at least 65 years old lives from their nearest school?
